This project is only for insane people right?
No of course it isn't. This is a program for console developers.
It's meant to be a tool used to easilly share console projects. 
And to create console websites. Why you ask? Why not use github?
Well if i want a console project from github then there are a lot of steps involved.
First I must find a console project.
Second I must download it.
Thirt I must compile the code.
And then i can finally run it.
It would be a lot easier if i could instantly run the program.

Also this project aims to create a console Markup Language.
It will look something like this.

\<text>\<colour>BLUE\</colour>This is blue text!!!\</text>
\<text>\<bold>This text is bold and blue\</bold>This is only blue\</text>
\<text>\<colour>RED\</colour>This text is red\</text>

And if you're interested how this will work well let me give you a brief explanation.
First you'll need to make a console project.
Then you'll need to get a domain and make a website.(doesn't need to be complicated. it can litterally be a title and an explanation)
Then upload your project.
And now everybody can open it and use/play it.

I'm not an experienced programmer so if you want to help let me know.
