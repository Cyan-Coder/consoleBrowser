This project is only for insane people right?
No of course it isn't. This is a program meant for use by console developers.
It's meant to be a tool used to easilly find and use console projects made by others. 
And you can use it to create console websites too.
Why you ask? Why not use github?

Well if you want a console project from github then there are a lot of steps involved.

First you must find a console project.
Then you must download it.
After that you must compile the code.(And hope that it works)
And then you can finally run it.
It would be a lot easier if you could search for it and instantly run the program.

Also this project involves console websites we also aim to create a custom console Markup Language.
Here's how it will work.

First you need to define your tags in a .def file.
Like this:

<p> = {
  type: TEXT;
  fontColour: RED;
  backColour: GREEN;
}

<a> = {
  type: LINK;
  fontColour: WHITE;
  backColour: BLUE;
}
  
After that you can create your website in a .chtml file.
like this:

@import "style.def" <--- this is the above written file

\<p>This text is RED with a GREEN background\</p>
\<a>http://youtube.com;This link is WHITE on BLUE and take you to youtube\</a>

As you can see it looks a bit like HTML. But the major difference is that in this markup language it's easy to create your own tags.

And if you're interested to know how the sharing of project will work well let me give you a brief explanation.

First you'll need to make a console project.
Then you'll need to get a domain and make a website.
(It doesn't need to be complicated. You can litterally only put the title of the program on the page)
Then upload your page and program.
And now everybody can find and run it.

As you can see it's a bit more work to upload your project.
But it's a lot easier for other people to find your program.

If you're interested to help let me know. Everyone is welcome to help us out.
