This project is only for insane people right?
No of course it isn't.
This is a program for console developers.
It's meant to be a tool used to easilly share console projects. 
And to create console websites. Why you ask? To which I reply: Why not.

Also this project aims to create a console Markup Language.
It will look something like this.

\<text>\<colour>BLUE</colour>This is blue text!!!</text>
<text><bold>This text is bold and blue</bold>This is only blue</text>
<text><colour>RED</colour>This text is red</text>

I'm not an experienced programmer so if you want to help let me know.
