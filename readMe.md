This project is only for insane people right?
No of course it isn't. This is a program for console developers.
It's meant to be a tool used to easilly share console projects. 
And to create console websites. Why you ask? Why not use github?
Well if i want a console project from github then there are a lot of steps involved.
First you must find a console project.
Then you must download it.
After that you must compile the code.
And then you can finally run it.
It would be a lot easier if you could search for it and instantly run the program.

Also this project aims to create a console Markup Language.
It will look something like this.

\<text>\<colour>BLUE\</colour>This is blue text!!!\</text>
\<text>\<bold>This text is bold and blue\</bold>This is only blue\</text>
\<text>\<colour>RED\</colour>This text is red\</text>

As you can see it looks like HTML. And that's because it would be easy to learn for everybody.
Since HTML is easy to wrap your head around.

And if you're interested to know how this will work well let me give you a brief explanation.
First you'll need to make a console project.
Then you'll need to get a domain and make a website.(doesn't need to be complicated. it can litterally be a title and an explanation)
Then upload your project.
And now everybody can open it and use/play it.

As you can guess it'll be a bit more work to upload your project.
But it'll be a lot easier for other people to find your program.

I'm not an experienced programmer so if you want to help or if you have a comment let me know.
